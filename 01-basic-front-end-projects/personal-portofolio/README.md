# FreeCodeCamp's Personal Protofolio Project

A "personal portofolio" style page build according to the FCC's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage">requirements</a> (shown below, as well as extra content).
> * I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
> * I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
> * I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
> * I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Built Using:

* #### `HTML`
* #### `CSS`
  * `FontAwesome`
  * `Google Fonts`
  * `CSS Reset`
* #### `JavaScript`
  * `jQuery`
  
  
Created my own scrollspy function.
