_(Not an actual portofolio page, built as a project to practice and have some fun)_
# FreeCodeCamp's Personal Protofolio Project

A "personal portofolio" style page build according to the FCC's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage">requirements</a> (shown below, as well as extra content).


> * Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/.
> * Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
> * User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
> * User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
> * User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
> * User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
