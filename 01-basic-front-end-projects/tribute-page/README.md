# FreeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page">Tribute Page Project</a>
I have decided to build a small site instead of a page.

The site is about my favorite TV series: "Game of Thrones".

Contains some basic information about the House Lannister from the Westeros continent.

Built with: <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code> and <code>Bootstrap</code>.
