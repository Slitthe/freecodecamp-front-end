<h1><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/check-for-palindromes">Task Details</a></h1>

Return <code>true</code> if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.

A <code>palindrome</code> is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

### Note
You'll need to remove all <b>non-alphanumeric characters</b> (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything lower case in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as <code>"racecar"</code>, <code>"RaceCar"</code>, and <code>"race CAR"</code> among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as <code>"2A3*3a2"</code>, <code>"2A3 3a2"</code>, and <code>"2_A3*3#A2"</code>.
