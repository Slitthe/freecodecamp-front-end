# <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/caesars-cipher">Task Details</a>

One of the simplest and most widely known `ciphers` is a `Caesar cipher`, also known as a `shift cipher`. In a `shift cipher` the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a></b> cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a></b> encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
