3. **User Story**: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

4. **User Story**: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

5. **User Story**: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.


## Features:
- Score display
- Current active player display
- Ability to choose who starts the game
- Reset the game at any point (confirmation is asked in order to prevent accidental press)
- Responsive to small devices
- If someone wins, the winning tiles flash for indication
- Can play player vs. player or player vs computer
