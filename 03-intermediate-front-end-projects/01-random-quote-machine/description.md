# TASKS

*	Every time youn press a button you see a different quote
*	Each quote is made up of at least the quote text and its author
*	There are social media buttons for Twitter and other social media sites where you can share the quote
*	Make it look pretty 


## How To Approach it

1.	Do the functionality First (really!!!)
	-	Each time you click the new quote button... well you get a new quote
	-	Change the text content of the quote element and the author
	-	Use the appropiate HTML semantic tags
	-	There are buttons/icons for at least 2 social media links where you click them it takes you to post the content of the quote


2.	Style it
	-	Start by Hardcoding a quote and an author, all inside of a container and a new quote button
	-	Make it look pretty, add some animations effect, some icons maybe
