Google API to show the nearest administrative area level 1 (example states for USA or counties for countries like France, or judete for Romania)

Show the weather by using the Dark Sky API:
  https://darksky.net/dev
  
 
-- get the weather by lat and long searching
-- if the user denies access to their location (which they should) you should also be able to manually enter a city nearby and do a google maps API request for that location;
    - show an error if that location is not valid (aka no results found)
